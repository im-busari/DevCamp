### Summary 

1. To do App (/todo_app) - simple todo built with [HTML], [Bootstrap] and [VanillaJS]
2. SWAPI (swapi.js) - fetched data using Star Wars API. I get the opening crawl for each film in the series and then looped through the array of planets to fetch their names. Finaly I created an array of objects with 2 properties ([opening_crawl], [planets]).
3. In Order (inOrder.js) - Implemented inOrder using the [callback] pattern.
4. In Order Promise - Implemented inOrder function using [promises].

### Notes
- please make sure your run npm install otherwise the swapi.js file won't work.
