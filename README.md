## License

If your project is open source, it's important to include a license.

## Changelog

Make a README is inspired by Keep a Changelog. A changelog is another file that is very useful for programming projects.

## Contributing

Just having a "Contributing" section in your README is a good start. Another approach is to split off your guidelines into their own file (CONTRIBUTING.md). If you use GitHub and have this file, then anyone who creates an issue or opens a pull request will get a link to it.

You can also create an issue template and a pull request template. These files give your users and collaborators templates to fill in with the information that you'll need to properly respond. This helps to avoid situations like getting very vague issues. Both GitHub and GitLab will use the templates automatically.
