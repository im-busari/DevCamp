## License

If your project is open source, it's important to include a license.

## Changelog

Make a README is inspired by Keep a Changelog. A changelog is another file that is very useful for programming projects.

## Contributing

Just having a "Contributing" section in your README is a good start. Another approach is to split off your guidelines into their own file (CONTRIBUTING.md). If you use GitHub and have this file, then anyone who creates an issue or opens a pull request will get a link to it.

You can also create an issue template and a pull request template. These files give your users and collaborators templates to fill in with the information that you'll need to properly respond. This helps to avoid situations like getting very vague issues. Both GitHub and GitLab will use the templates automatically.

# Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name

Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.


## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.


## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
